This is a scraped archive of posts from the Portable Antiquities Scheme blogs that could be found in the Wayback machine. 
They have been converted from HTML to markdown and are being rendered on the Jekyll engine to make sure they are available 
again. In late 2013, I suffered a server failure, and corrupt back ups of the old blogs.
 
As the British Museum seems to be rationalising the web site portfolio and deleting old records, I'm putting these onto
Github for free hosting via Gh-Pages. 

I hope they may be useful.
