Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery have organised a season of Sunday afternoon lectures on the Staffordshire Hoard. These lectures will address four very different aspects of the hoard from its initial discovery and study, the conservation work being undertaken, and what it all means for Mercia and Britain in the Early Medieval Period. It is expected that demand for places will be high so book early to avoid disappointment !!!

The Lectures:
