Fortuitous timing – my blog starts during this year’s cavalcade of events that make up the [Festival of British Archaeology](https://festival.britarch.ac.uk/) 2010.  It’s the fortnight that I trot off round the county (and slightly beyond\*) so that people can show me the finds they have made without having to stray too far from home.

My week began at [Rockbourne Roman Villa](https://www3.hants.gov.uk/museum/rockbourne-roman-villa.htm) where I saw all sorts of pottery and flint finds, mostly discovered by youngsters – budding archaeologists of the future?  I have since been to [Andover Museum](https://www3.hants.gov.uk/museum/andover-museum.htm), [Southampton](https://www.southampton.gov.uk/s-leisure/artsheritage/museums-galleries/ghtower-museumofarchaeology/), [Christchurch](https://www3.hants.gov.uk/museum/redhouse.htm) (technically now in Dorset\*), finally ending up in [Portsmouth](https://www.portsmouthcitymuseums.co.uk/) where a celebratory ice cream was enjoyed.  For full details of all our events are available in the [events calendar](https://www.finds.org.uk/events)

I have taken some finds in for recording onto the [database](https://finds.org.uk/database/) which is exciting.  If you have missed me then feel free to [get in touch](https://finds.org.uk/contacts) to arrange an appointment to see me in Winchester.  You could also drop objects off at your local museum which, if recordable, will be forwarded to me.  To make sure, request that they are marked for my attention.

I look forward to meeting you, if not during the next Festival then at your convenience in Winchester.  Enjoy what remains of the 2010 Festival of British Archaeology!
