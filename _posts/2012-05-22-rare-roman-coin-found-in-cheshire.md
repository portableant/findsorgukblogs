title: Rare Roman coin found in Cheshire!
---

A rare Roman as has been recently found in Cheshire. The coin is a copper alloy as of Nerva, (96-98AD). It has been recorded on the database as LVPL-716282.

The coin is as follows:  
Obverse: IMP NERVA CAES AVG P M TR P COS III PP; laureate head right.  
Reverse: NEPTVNO CIRCENS\[I? CONSTIT\]VT S C; Neptune standing right, holding acrostolium in right hand and trident in left hand; to left small figure half-emerging from ground.  
BMC 3 (1966) (Nerva, no. 132 and p. 553).  
In 1984, Georges de Loye wrote about this type (Revue Numismatique 1984, pp. 95-103). He noted that 1 specimen was from France, another from Germany, but five from Britain (one in Oxford, one in Cambridge and three in the British Museum). Therefore, he surmised that this was an issue intended for use in Britain. This coin type was at one time regarded as a fake, and is categorised as such in RIC 2. It is, however, included in the revision of BMC 3 (1966) as genuine.

The most common Roman coin type found in Cheshire is the nummus, 231 of which have been recorded on the database from the area. Currently only 38 asses have been recorded from Cheshire four of which were found around Chester. It is very exciting to have such a rare coin recorded from the Chester area.
