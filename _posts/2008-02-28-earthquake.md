Lincolnshire is certainly on the map after Wednesdays earthquake, which measured 5.2 on the Richter scale. Afterwards the quake got me thinking about just how many hoards or ritual deposits we see in the county were made after such natural events as an earthquake, a tornado or a lightning storm. I live just 10 miles from the epicentre and even though I know what causes earthquakes, the experience was still pretty frightning. Just how much more terrifying would they have been to our prehistoric ancestors who probably perceived the quake as an angry god shuffling his feet?

After a quake of Wednesdays’ magnitude you could quite imaging Bronze Age or Iron Age communities getting together to make sacrificial offerings to appease the gods.  I wonder how many finds we have recorded are silent witnesses to natural events such as these?
