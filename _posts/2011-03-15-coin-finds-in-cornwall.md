        <p>The nature of the Roman occupation of Cornwall remains elusive, largely due to the scarcity of sites and
            finds. However, the <acronym title="Portable Antiquities Scheme">PAS</acronym> has played a significant role
            in the discovery of several new sites, including the fort at Restormel. The steadily growing number of
            site-finds of Roman coins (now standing at 294) is a highly important dataset. Amongst these coins is a
            large assemblage from the Hayle area which highlights the importance of this region in the late Roman
            period. The graph below shows the chronological distribution of coins from before AD 41 (Period 1) to AD
            388-402 (Period 21). Hayle is shown against the only other comparable site from the whole of Cornwall,
            Trevelgue.</p>

        <p>Furthermore, the <acronym title="Portable Antiquities Scheme">PAS</acronym> coins overall provide a higher
            proportion of late Roman coins than is shown by past coin hoards. The <acronym
                    title="Portable Antiquities Scheme">PAS</acronym> data was instrumental for a recent MA dissertation
            on Roman Cornwall written at Leicester University. It is also important to note that important new Roman
            discoveries are being recorded with the <acronym title="Portable Antiquities Scheme">PAS</acronym> in Devon
            and that the work in both counties combined will help to produce a new understanding of the South-West
            Peninsula as a whole in the coming years.</p>

        <p>The graph below shows how the coin profile over time for Cornwall is very different from the national average
            for Britain. The time periods range from pre-AD 41 (Period 1) to AD 388- 402 (Period 21).</p>

        <p>Finally, Cornwall has produced a number of Late Roman and Byzantine coins from the Eastern Mediterranean.
            This does suggest sea trade coming out of the Straits of Gibraltar and across the Bay of Biscay to Cornwall.
            What is really interesting is that such coins are also being found on the Isle of Wight â€“ in fact, the
            <acronym title="Portable Antiquities Scheme">PAS</acronym> is showing that Cornwall and the Isle of Wight
            share much more in common than we previously thought.</p>
