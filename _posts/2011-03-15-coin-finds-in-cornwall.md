The nature of the Roman occupation of Cornwall remains elusive, largely due to the scarcity of sites and finds. However, the PAS has played a significant role in the discovery of several new sites, including the fort at Restormel. The steadily growing number of site-finds of Roman coins (now standing at 294) is a highly important dataset. Amongst these coins is a large assemblage from the Hayle area which highlights the importance of this region in the late Roman period. The graph below shows the chronological distribution of coins from before AD 41 (Period 1) to AD 388-402 (Period 21). Hayle is shown against the only other comparable site from the whole of Cornwall, Trevelgue.

Furthermore, the PAS coins overall provide a higher proportion of late Roman coins than is shown by past coin hoards. The PAS data was instrumental for a recent MA dissertation on Roman Cornwall written at Leicester University. It is also important to note that important new Roman discoveries are being recorded with the PAS in Devon and that the work in both counties combined will help to produce a new understanding of the South-West Peninsula as a whole in the coming years.

The graph below shows how the coin profile over time for Cornwall is very different from the national average for Britain. The time periods range from pre-AD 41 (Period 1) to AD 388- 402 (Period 21).

Finally, Cornwall has produced a number of Late Roman and Byzantine coins from the Eastern Mediterranean. This does suggest sea trade coming out of the Straits of Gibraltar and across the Bay of Biscay to Cornwall. What is really interesting is that such coins are also being found on the Isle of Wight â€“ in fact, the PAS is showing that Cornwall and the Isle of Wight share much more in common than we previously thought.
