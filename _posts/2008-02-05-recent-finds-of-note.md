Recent finds of note
====================

Posted on [February 5, 2008](http://finds.org.uk/blogs/somerset/2008/02/05/recent-finds-of-note/ "2:25 pm") by [npayne](http://finds.org.uk/blogs/somerset/author/npayne/ "View all posts by npayne")

These two objects were recently discovered near Charlton Mackrell in South Somerset. They are both pretty unusual for Somerset and it has been difficult to find a close parallel for the second.

The first find is a copper alloy knobbed terret harness fitting (SOM-9455E3) which probably dates from the second century AD. Terret rings were metal loops which served as rein guides on horse-drawn vehicles. Terrets would have been positioned on the yoke, like on this reconstruction (see below) of the Newbridge chariot which has recently been built by a Somerset craftsman, Robert Hurford, and is on display at the Somerset County Museum in Taunton until is taken to its new home at the National Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh.

PAS record number: SOM-9455E3
Object type: Harness fitting
Broadperiod: Roman
County of discovery: Somerset
Stable url: [https://finds.org.uk/database/artefacts/record/id/203963](https://finds.org.uk/database/artefacts/record/id/203963 "SOM-9455E3: a Roman Harness fitting")

The knobbed terret is a Roman type (rather than Iron Age, when terrets first appeared)Â and although they are occasionally found in 1st century contexts most seem to be of 2nd century AD date. The terret consists of a oval loop which has a lozenge-shaped cross-section around most of its circumference, with the exception of a short section which has a narrowed rectangular cross-section in between a pair of wider collars. This part of the terret would have been secured onto the yoke (see reconstruction below). The loop becomes slightly thicker before it joins the collars, which have oval cross-sections and decoration in the form of a circumferential grooved line. Originally there would have been three knops projecting from the outside of the loop, but one of these (that opposite the narrowed section) has broken off. The two surviving knops are sub-spherical and each is decorated with a single circumferential grooved line. They are purely decorative.

The second find is a copper alloy toggle ([SOM-946D43](http://www.findsdatabase.org.uk/hms/pas_obj.php?type=finds&id=0014769474301B8A)) of late Iron Age or early Roman date. The toggle is cylindrical with a loop on one side, which would have been used to attach the toggle to clothing or horse harness. The loop has a broader curving central section which narrows slightly on each side before flaring out again at the point where it meets the main body of the toggle. At each end of the cylinder is a slightly expanded terminal which contains a deep and wide groove on the side opposite the loop. There is a further similar feature in the centre of the bar. Lipped decoration such as this is more commonly seen on late Iron Age terret harness fittings.
