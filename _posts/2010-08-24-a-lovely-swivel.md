# Another lovely swivel


As promised back in [July]({{ site.baseurl }}2010/07/12/a-rather-lovely-swivel/) I have had another interesting swivel:

[![]({{ site.baseurl }}files/2010/08/SUSS-101B44-1024x480.jpg)]({{ site.baseurl }}files/2010/08/SUSS-101B44.jpg)

[SUSS-101B44](http://finds.org.uk/database/artefacts/record/id/391910) is of a more typical form than the one I highlighted previously ([SUSS-225F31](http://finds.org.uk/database/artefacts/record/id/395344)). It has a small loop with animal heads at the ends biting a domed centre from which projects a circular pin. This is the ‘male’ half of a two part swivel, similar to [SF-CA5816](http://finds.org.uk/database/artefacts/record/id/252217).

What is particularly interesting to me is the remains of strap ends attached on to the loop of the swivel. Their form means they were attached during manufacture and couldn’t be removed. I had always assumed the straps simply went through the loop of the swivel and rubbed directly on it. This solution, with the strap ends, both reduces the wear on the strap if it is moving a great deal and also allows two straps to be taken off the same swivel.

A quick search has not brought up any parallels although more diligent searching might bring some to light. It may be this was a particular response to the need to take two straps off one swivel or to using straps of a different, less hard-wearing material, a woven strip rather than leather perhaps. Again this item sheds new light on a common class of artefact and helps us understand them in a different way and perhaps highlights again that this is a class of artefact that would benefit from more research.
