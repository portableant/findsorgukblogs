Conserving the Frome Hoard
==========================

Since the last post, the majority of coins from the Frome Hoard are still at their temporary home–The British Museum.  
In 2010, a huge team effort allowed for the 52,503 coins to be cleaned of mud and clay by museum conservators and sorted
by Roman coin specialists. 

Now, two years on from its discovery, the process to study and understand the hoard continues.  The coins were handed to 
two conservators–Ana Tam and Natalie Mitchell–for further work to reveal the fine details hidden beneath the corroded
surfaces.  The next few posts will show what goes on when tens of thousands of coins require conservation. 

Here’s an idea of what the coins looked like at the start:
