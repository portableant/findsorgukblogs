PAS Finds from Shropshire and Herefordshire published in West Midlands Archaeology
==================================================================================

Every year the PAS team in the West Midlands are asked to contribute to West Midlands Archaeology, a journal that tries to capture all the archaeological work carried out within the year (see [http://www.britarch.ac.uk/cbawm/WMA.php](http://www.britarch.ac.uk/cbawm/WMA.php)). We as a group try and identify objects that are both locally and regionally imporant finds; however we also like to highlight particularly good examples of more common or  specific types of find.

The volume that covers 2009 (WMA 52) is currently being edited for publictaion. And we are now starting to think about those finds for 2010.

As some of you may know from reading my reports I have a tendency for writing considerable amounts and therefore this year the editor has published summaries of some the PAS finds in the journal but also published the full text on the CBA West Midlands website

Rather than copying and pasting these finds on here – I thought I would direct people to have a look at the article over there – all the finds highlighted are really rather impressive and also important. In addition I would also like to thank the finders who made these artefacts available for recording especially as I had to borrow them for longer than usual to have them illustrated

The full PAS records for each find can be found below
