Latest Wirral Brooch
--------------------

Just this week I have recorded a Wirral brooch which was actually found on the Wirral. This is the exact place we want
to see them, keep them coming! This is a great example as most of the distinguishing features are still visible despite
some wear and corrosion and the enamel is still so bright. Look it up on the database at LVPL-64EDF0.
