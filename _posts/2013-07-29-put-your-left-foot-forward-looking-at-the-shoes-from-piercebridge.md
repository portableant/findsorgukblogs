Looking at the shoes from Piercebridge</a></h2>

    <p>A couple of weeks ago, the project was lucky to have Dr Beth Greene, an expert in Roman shoes, from the University of Western Ontario, take a look at our small assemblage of leather from the river. She&#8217;s worked extensively on the Roman shoes from Vindolanda (<a href="http://www.vindolanda.com/doorway-articles/life-at-vindolanda" class="liexternal">http://www.vindolanda.com/doorway-articles/life-at-vindolanda</a>), so she&#8217;s well placed to study our footwear! Here&#8217;s what she has to say about them:</p>

<p>&#8220;At the moment, only three Roman leather shoes have been recovered from the river deposit for study. However, Bob and Rolfe have re-buried dozens more, so there&#8217;s massive potential for further work which could keep me busy for some time!</p>
<p>So, here’s the good news: the shoes are <strong>most definitely Roman!</strong> They are all very well preserved and tell us a great deal about their previous owners and perhaps also the individual who deposited them in this watery resting place. One is a small sandal of about 22cm long (before chemical conservation) that may have belonged to a woman or an adolescent male. The sandal is an interesting shape that developed at the end of the 2<sup>nd</sup> century and into the 3<sup>rd</sup>, with a flat toe area and very wide at the toes and ball of the foot. This sandal type evolves to become enormous at the toe end and eventually looks more like a ping-pong paddle than a shoe! Our example is more sensible in its stylistic details, but still has a flare that can only be chalked up to fashionable tastes rather than practicality.</p>
<div id="attachment_158" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://finds.org.uk/blogs/piercebridge/files/2013/07/1.jpg" class="liimagelink" rel="lightbox[154]"><img class="size-medium wp-image-158 " alt="A leather shoe, with fashionable paddle-shaped foot." src="http://finds.org.uk/blogs/piercebridge/files/2013/07/1-300x198.jpg" width="300" height="198" /></a>

<p>Another shoe also follows the trends of the time with a very pointed toe. There are at least 6-10 cm. at the end of this insole that would never have been properly walked in, but exist in order to create a certain style for the shoe with a very elongated and pointed toe. This style became popular toward the end of the 2<sup>nd</sup> century. I often think these look a lot like modern ‘winklepickers’, a shoe style inspired by medieval French nobles and popular since the 1950s with rock and rollers, mods, goths, and punks—generally the footwear choice of many culturally alternative groups. I don’t think this is what the Romans had in mind. It was just a fashion trend as far as I surmise, but it just goes to show that the Romans were once again the innovators!</p>
<p>With luck there will be more shoes to look at it to provide some statistically significant data. It&#8217;s early days right now and possibly pure coincidence, but one interesting detail is that all three shoes are left-footed, the inauspicious and evil side as far as the Romans were concerned (the Latin word for left is ‘sinistra’<i>, </i>where we get the English word ‘sinister’). If I were giving away one shoe to the deity, I’d surely pick the one that brings bad luck!</p>
