The Satyricon
-------------

October 10th, 2008 by Philippa Walton

I’ve come to the end of my year of data collection and have brought together more than 800 site coin profiles from England. It’s involved looking through more than 62 000Â Roman coin records on the database, scanning hundreds of excavation reports and reading every county journal published since 1990! I’ve just come accross a quote from Petronius’ _Satyricon_ which I think sums up what I (and other applied numismatists) have been doing quite well.

…’They will pick even the smallest coins out of the muck-heap with their teeth’…

Now that combing through the muck is over, I need to do some work on what all those tiny coins mean. Statistics and Correspondence Analysis here I come!
