Small figurines in the shape of boars were popular in the Late Iron Age and Early Roman period, although the findspot of this example is unusually far West. They are thought to have a votive role, possibly relating to local hunting cults, unfortunately stratified finds are rare. The late Iron Age examples are usually complete, although stylised, figures. Examples with just the head and foreparts become more common in the Early Roman period.

This example ([SOM-B820E3](http://finds.org.uk/database/artefacts/record/id/530918)) has a well moulded head with a long snout and deeply drilled eyes, which gives it a rather fierce appearance seen face on. The crest of bristles along the back is emphasised by incised lines. It swells out initially to make the upper part of the body before narrowing to a plain rectangular base. At the tail end it tapers to a rounded point, this is broken but is too narrow to have formed an attachment to a larger implement such as a knife although it may have had some indication of a tail. It may have been freestanding on the base or fitted into a larger base piece.

The closest parallel in terms of form is from a smaller knife handle from Chester Roman fort and dated to the Hadrianic period or later, supporting the suggestion this is Early Roman rather than Iron Age in date.
