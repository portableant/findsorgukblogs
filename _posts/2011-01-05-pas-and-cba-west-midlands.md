Thought I would let people know of the revamped CBA West Midlands website which is now up and running. It can be found at

[http://www.britarch.ac.uk/cbawm/](http://www.britarch.ac.uk/cbawm/)

There are lots of useful links to events and activities, whether it is Young Archaeology Clubs or museums in the West Midlands to visit, as well as a host of useful contact details – including us in the PAS West Midlands team

There is also a link to register for the dayschool ‘News from the Past: the latest Archaeological Discoveries in the West Midlands.’ This will be held on Saturday 26 February 2011, 10.00am – 4.45pm at The Library Theatre, Birmingham Central Library B3 3HQ.

For details and full list of speakers see:

The two PAS related topics / lectures in this Dayschool are:

The Portable Antiquities Scheme and recent discoveries in the West Midlands by Tom Brindle, Finds Liaison Officer for Staffordshire & West Midlands

and

The Staffordshire Hoard: one year on and its conservation by Deborah Cane of Birmingham Museums & Art Gallery

… but there are also lots of other interesting lectures as part of the day.
