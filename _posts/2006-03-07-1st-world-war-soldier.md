Sometimes we get objects handed in that are of more recent historical importance. Last week I was handed a coin of Naopleon III which has been filed down and stamped with a British soldiers details as follows:

GA FIRTH  
37078  
WES  
2 LANC FUS

This is from private George Firth of the Lancashire Fusiliers, soldier number 37078. Iâ€™m not sure what WES stands for ~ perhaps WES as in religion WESLEYN?

The National Archives have some interesting documents online, including war medals, from which I downloaded his record. Anyone know how to read it?
