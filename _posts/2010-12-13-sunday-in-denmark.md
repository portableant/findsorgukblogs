Sunday
======

Arrived in Denmark late last night, after a pleasant flight with Atlantic Airlines. Spent most of the flight reading Beowulf – the first travel guide written in English about Denmark – and now I am a bit worried about going to any public houses (aka mead-halls) here! The transfer from Copenhagen central station to the airport was very quick (12mins), which contrasted to the trip to the airport in London…

Danish fact: Danish is a very complicated language, and even the Danes aren’t that good at writing it: they always seem to be crossing letters out. Maybe that is why everyone speaks English so well…
