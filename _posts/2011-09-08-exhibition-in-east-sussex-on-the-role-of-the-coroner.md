Exhibition in East Sussex on the role of the Coroner
----------------------------------------------------

September 8th, 2011 by Ian Richardson

Television shows and movies, and sadly, real-life tragic events have familiarised the public with the concept of the coroner as the person who investigates sudden or mysterious deaths. Important as this is, it represents only one aspect of the coroner’s duties.

Coroners also play an important part in the administration of the Treasure Act 1996. The coroner is the body to whom finds of potential Treasure must be reported, and he or she decides -

a.) whether the find constitutes Treasure under the terms of the Treasure Act 1996
b.) who should be regarded as the finder or finders
c.) the nature of the find circumstances – specifically where and when the item(s) was found.

The Eastbourne Society (East Sussex) has organised a temporary exhibition at the Eastbourne Heritage Centre on the many roles of local magistrates, the coroner in particular.  The exhibition **‘Crime, Punishment and Local Justice’**, runs through 29 October 2011.  Among other things it sheds light on the coroner’s place in the Treasure process and provides information about the various stages involved in inquests into items of Treasure, their valuation and acquistion by museums.  More information on the exhibition and the Eastbourne Heritage Centre can be found [here](http://www.eastbourneheritagecentre.co.uk/welcome/welcome.html "Eastbourne Heritage Centre").  

With upwards of 20 cases of potential Treasure reported every year since 2004 in East Sussex, the coroner’s office there has certainly been well occupied in fulfilling its duties in this respect.   

The Heritage Centre is run mostly by volunteers, and looks a lovely place to visit if you have the opportunity.
