MIDAS XML Schema – PAS
======================

The Scheme engaged OAD to write the XML Schema for the transfer of data from our database into regional Historic Environment 
Records. Documentation can be found here:  
[http://heritage-standards.org/midas/docs/object/](http://heritage-standards.org/midas/docs/object/)  
And an example can be found here:  
[http://heritage-standards.org/midas/examples/object\_example.xml](http://heritage-standards.org/midas/examples/object_example.xml)  
This is still in the drafting process and will be formalised soon…..
