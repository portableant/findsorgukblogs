Possible ‘Trench art’ ring, SOM-AE96C7
======================================

In general I don’t record finds that are less than 300 years old. Not because they are not interesting but firstly because the quantity is too great, secondly because we have usually have more and better sources to use to identify and categorise sites of this period and thirdly because, to be frank, with the huge increase in manufactured goods and machines there are a lot more odd bent bits of metal that are hard to identify.
However sometimes something comes in with a nice local link or that is just fun and I know it will be useful in talks or schools sessions. This finger ring from Hinton St George is an example, find number [SOM-AE96C7](http://finds.org.uk/database/artefacts/record/id/507872).

Finger ring made of 1940 penny


It is made from a copper penny dated 1940. The penny was carefully cut, folded and shaped to retain the reverse legend, head of Britannia and date on the inner side of the ring while the outer side was either smoothed or has worn smooth through wear. Given the date it is possible this was made by someone during the war, either a soldier, prisoner of war or someone else with time on their hands waiting for orders and access to cheap items and tools that could be easily carried in a pocket. Such pieces are known as ‘trench art’ after the items produced during the First World War and continue to be made today during modern conflicts. Finger rings made from coins were a popular form of trench art.
