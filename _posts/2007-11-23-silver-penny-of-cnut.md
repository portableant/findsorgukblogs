Thought i’d share this little gem with you all recently found in the County – a silver hammered penny of King Cnut (1016-1035).  This is a ‘pointed helmet’ type, for obvious reasons, and so can be dated a little narrower to AD1024-30.  The obverse reads ‘CNUT REX ANG’.

The reverse is very interesting because this penny is from the mint at Lincoln., and the moneyer is none other than ‘Grimcetel’ (inspiration if any of you are trying to choose baby names at the moment). Usually Cnut pennies from Lincoln have a trefoil of pellets after CNUT, however if you look closely, this one doesn’t.
