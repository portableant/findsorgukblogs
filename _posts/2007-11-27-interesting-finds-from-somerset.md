Interesting finds from Somerset
===============================

Posted on [November 27, 2007](http://finds.org.uk/blogs/somerset/2007/11/27/interesting-finds-from-somerset/ "6:21 pm") by [npayne](http://finds.org.uk/blogs/somerset/author/npayne/ "View all posts by npayne")

Below are details of a couple of interesting Somerset finds which have been reported through the Scheme in recent weeks. The first is a near complete socketed axehead of late Bronze Age (c. 1000-800BC) date (SOM-C03882). This is a fairly plain bronze axe which fits into the the South-eastern A1 category of the Ewart Park phase. What makes it particularly interesting is that it is a garden found, discovered whilst digging new flowerbeds in a house in Langford Budville, near Wellington.

An unusual early Roman brooch (SOM-304001) has come up in the Charlton Mackrell area. This is a variant of an aesica brooch, of which only two Somerset examples have previously been recorded on the Portable Antiquities Scheme database. The brooch has been cast in two pieces which are rivetted together and is undecorated. There is a good unprovenced parallel in Richard Hattatt’s ‘Visual Catalogue’ (2000). There are some fairly strong regional variations in the distribution of Roman brooches which Sally Worrell has been researching. The most common type recorded for Somerset is the T-shape as can be seen on the graph below.

A lovely flint chisel arrowhead (SOM-AFA743) has been recorded from Queen Camel. This is a type characteristic of the late Neolithic and early Bronze Age. It is wedge-shaped and has been invasively retouched over most of the dorsal surface and part of the ventral surface (to sharpen the business end).
