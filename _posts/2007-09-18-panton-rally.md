Hello again,

Well, i’m back from a busy three days recording finds at the Panton rally, Lincs.  Thanks to all who offered up finds for recording. We had just under 200 finds from the weekend, including the usual array of Roman grots, hammered pennies and strap ends.  Interestingly, thanks to your reporting it now looks like we’ve now got a new Early-Middle Saxon site.

It will take a few weeks to get the finds on to the database, so please bear with me and keep checking back on the blog for updates.  Sam, our roman coin expert has some interesting ideas on the late Roman period in this area, and hopefully the coins from the rally confirmed his crackpot theories.

We only had one negative comment from the rally – apparently there was better FLO totty at Water Newton. Pfff.
