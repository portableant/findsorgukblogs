# Getting access to your finds]

Building the Scheme’s new database was fraught with a huge array of privacy problems ranging from findspot to personal details. The Scheme takes this very seriously, but we do recognise that our registered users have always had a desire to get access to their records that the Scheme has recorded on their behalf. Many finders have hundreds of objects, some just have one; but, they all would like to be able to access these without searching for them/

What has been done is pretty simple and we need to do a few things before you can access your finds easily (and this obviously only works for those that have recorded!) These are:

*   Register for a [user account](http://www.finds.org.uk/users/account/register "Register with us") with us (if you don’t have one already)
*   Contact your local [finds liaison officer](http://www.finds.org.uk/contacts "A list of our staff") and tell them your user name
*   They then link your user account to the details that we safeguard on our database
*   Voila, next time you login, you have access to your finds (published and those on validation) from your logged in area. Look for the link that says “My finds recorded by FLOs” and which looks like the below image

Coming in the next few days to complement this are a couple of features:

*   Mapping of your finds from your home address (if we have it)
*   Distance travelled for your furthest discovery
*   RSS feeds of your objects so you could embed them on your own site

Hopefully, this new feature will enable many to find objects that they could never retrieve from our old database. One caveat, as we have 17,000 people registered on the system, there maybe a delay enabling you.
