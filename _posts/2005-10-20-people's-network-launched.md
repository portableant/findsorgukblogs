# People’s Network launched

MLA, our administering organisation launched their new online services from England’s public libraries yesterday, entitled the [People’s Network](https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.peoplesnetwork.gov.uk/). 

This is quite a colourful aggregator for information  from disparate sources. Sort of an HEIRNET type idea, or online portals.  I’ve found a few critical comments from Paul Miller today about this resource and I can see where a lot of these are
going. For example: [Thinking about the Future](http://www.paulmiller.typepad.com/thinking_about_the_future/2005/10/peoples_network.html).

This facility is largely based on OAI techology, not something I am a great fan of. Our data was meant to be included, but I am not sure if this actually happened in the end, as their developers were having problems with their syntax for searching our database. The Scheme is actually missing from their links for archaeology, which is surprising.

MLA’s press office released their take on [events here](http://www.mla.gov.uk/news/press_article.asp?articleid=863) and we’ll no doubt hear more in the future.

I’ll add some pictures to this thread later on after I get access to the press area.
