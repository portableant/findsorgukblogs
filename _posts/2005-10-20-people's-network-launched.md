        <p><acronym title="Museums, Libraries and Archives Council">MLA</acronym>, our administering organisation
            launched their new online services from England’s public libraries yesterday, entitled the <a
                    href="http://www.peoplesnetwork.gov.uk/" class="liexternal">People’s Network</a>. This is quite a
            colourful aggregator for information from disparate sources. Sort of an HEIRNET type idea, or online
            portals.<br>
            I’ve found a few critical comments from Paul Miller today about this resource and I can see where a lot of
            these are going. For example: <a
                    href="http://www.paulmiller.typepad.com/thinking_about_the_future/2005/10/peoples_network.html"
                    class="liexternal">Thinking about the Future</a>.</p>

        <p>This facility is largely based on OAI techology, not something I am a great fan of. Our data was meant to be
            included, but I am not sure if this actually happened in the end, as their developers were having problems
            with their syntax for searching our database. The Scheme is actually missing from their links for
            archaeology, which is surprising.</p>

        <p><acronym title="Museums, Libraries and Archives Council">MLA</acronym>’s press office released their take on
            <a href="http://www.mla.gov.uk/news/press_article.asp?articleid=863" class="liexternal">events here</a> and
            we’ll no doubt here more in the future. I’ll add some pictures to this thread later on after I get access to
            the press area.</p></div>
