            <p class="wp-caption-text">Coin of Domitianus</p></div>
        <p>One of the Scheme’s objects has just been featured in the American Institute of Archaeology’s magazine, aptly
            titled “Archaeology”. This documents the discovery of the Domitianus coin, which you may hear more of come
            November 9th! I’ll let you wait for that!<br>
            <a href="http://www.archaeology.org/online/features/coin/index.html"
               title="Archaeology's article on Domitianus" class="liexternal">Finding a Lost Emperor in a Clay
                Pot</a><br>
            The article does mention the Treasure Act, but probably points to the wrong place for it, the CBA pages.
            Instead they would have been better off sending them to our treasure pages which explain it for the
            layman.<br>
            I think Ian Leins will be amused that the numismatist or conservator has been called an archaeologist, as he
            is adamant that he is not and will never be an archaeologist. The <acronym
                    title="The British Museum">BM</acronym>’s department of Coins &amp; Medals webpages have their take
            on this <a href="http://www.thebritishmuseum.ac.uk/cm/Domitianus.html" title="Domitianus story from the BM"
                       class="liexternal">coin here.</a></p></div>
