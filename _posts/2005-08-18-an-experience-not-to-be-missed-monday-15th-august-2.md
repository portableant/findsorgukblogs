A fragment of gold runic inscription

**Monday 15th August**

One of the forum members from Croatia posted the comment “Surely those are runes on the sides?” , Another poster said “the runic symbols on there seem to say that it was a gift to Odin and Tyr for a safe journey”………

There were suggestions it could be Viking Hack Gold, a part pommel cap, a votive offering to the Gods, a talismanic piece, amulet or charm, part of a finger ring, part of a Bridle. The academics on the Portable Antiquities Forum were also very complimentary about the find offering suggestions of what it could be – now this was getting to be exciting to say the least.

After a phone call to my local museum, I find that my Finds Liaison Officer isn’t in today. I decide to take half a days holiday tomorrow morning and hope that she is “in the office” and not out and about.

I need to hand this in to her as soon as possible because I am away from this weekend. The possibility of the find being Treasure means that I have to get it reported within 14 days..

There appears to be a great deal of interest in this little find – and I still have no idea what it is.
