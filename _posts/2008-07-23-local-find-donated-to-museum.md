        <p>A detectorist has recently donated a really interesting find to National Museums Liverpool. It was found in
            the Hale area of Cheshire which is just outside Liverpool. It&#8217;s locality makes it more important as
            north of the River Mersey finds are not abundant- especially finds as nice as this one. This find will
            hopefully go into the new Museum of Liverpool which is planned to open in 2010</p>

        <p>The find is a face mount, from furniture or a vessel. It is Roman in date but has Celtic influences in it&#8217;s
            design. It is recorded on the database as <a href="http://finds.org.uk/database/artefacts/record/id/224911"
                                                         class="liinternal">LVPL-1DBDD5</a>. It is a female face,
            representing Medusa, one of the Gorgons, and the only one who was mortal. Her gaze could turn whoever she
            looked upon to stone. There is a particular myth in which Medusa was originally a beautiful maiden. She
            desecrated Athena&#8217;s temple by lying there with Poseidon. Outraged, Athena turned Medusa&#8217;s hair
            into living snakes. Medusa is represented as a fierce female nearly always with a frontal rather than a
            profile head. She was often used as an apotropaic amulet.</p></div>
