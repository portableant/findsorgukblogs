[Further Alloy Analysis on the Wirral brooches]({{ site.baseurl }}/files/2010/08/Update-for-Museums.pdf)

If you click onto the link above I have a short update on the Wirral brooch project. I was lucky enough to get some funding from Historic Scotland to pay for Dr. Matthew Pontingâ€™s travel and time to come up to Edinburgh and do some analysis on the Scottish sub-group of the Wirral brooches.

We were testing these to see if their alloys were the same as the brooches we had tested from the core area of the distribution. They are stylistically the same yet geographically very far away so I was hoping that the alloy composition would help us answer the question of whether the Scottish sub-group was made in Scotland, or around the Wirral.

My dissertation is almost finished and so more will follow on my study of these brooches soon!
