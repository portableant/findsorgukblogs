Regular finds surgeries at Wells Museum
=======================================

I have recently arranged to hold a new monthly finds event at Wells Museum which will take place on the first Wednesday of each month, between 11am and 3pm. Finds can be brought in for identification and recording on the day, or you can come in anytime the museum is open and drop in items for me to look at the next time  come in. Hopefully I’ll be able to reach more of the detectorists from the eastern part of the county, but of course anyone with archaeological finds (metalwork, pottery, worked flint etc) is very welcome to come along. The first surgery will be on Wednesday 3rd October 2007.
