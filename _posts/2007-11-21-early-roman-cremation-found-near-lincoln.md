title: Early Roman cremation found near Lincoln
---

Those of you who are up early and listen to BBC Radio Lincolnshire may have heard the report of a 1st/2nd century cremation urn.  The urn was found about a year ago in someones front garden in the St Katherines area near South Park, Lincolnshire.

It was a jaw-dropping moment when I saw the object being brought in at a recent finds day – by far the most unusual and rare object i’ve had in during a finds day!

The urn was nearly complete and contained the ashes and partially-burnt bone of an individual.  One bone showed curious knife marks, and until the bone is analysed we can’t be sure whether this particular bone belongs to the deceased or an animal sacrifice associated with the cremation.

The find spot was not too suprising, given that it is on a main road in to the city, and outside the city walls.  Roman law stated that you couldn’t bury within the city walls.
