It’s taken just over six months, but I have now just about looked at all the Roman coin records on the PAS database. Ive updated a few and added Reece periods to many and parish by parish, county by county begun to build up a picture of what’s happening nationwide (well England-wide to be precise).

Excitingly there are 469 parishes England-wide with more than 20 ‘Reeceable’ coins so I’ve got a lot of data to play with. Next step is to encourage detectorists to bring forward assemblages to their local FLOs, especially in some of the more patchy areas (Kent and County Durham being two) and to look for some good excavation coin assemblages.

Then it’s on to the analysis stage and the possibilities are endless…I’ll be looking to assess site function through coin profile (I’m particularly interested in rural shrines and temples) and to see whether I can make sense of some obvious regional patterning.
