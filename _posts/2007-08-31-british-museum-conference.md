Archaeology 2008 – A conference at the British Museum, 9th-10th February 2008:

A call for papers

A major new conference sponsored by Current Archaeology and the British Museum’s Department of Portable Antiquities and Treasure (Portable Antiquities Scheme) is being held at the British Museum on the weekend of 9th to 10th February 2008 to demonstrate the best current work being undertaken in British Archaeology. The conference will be divided into 20 minute slots. Lecturers will be expected to deliver a lively, informative and entertaining exposition of their work. Members of the Dept of Portable Antiquities and Treasure will be giving some lectures, but the organisers would love to have contributions from other members of the British Museum, especially those working overseas.

Please send your bids to [conference@archaeology.co.uk](mailto:conference@archaeology.co.uk), giving the title of the proposed talk, the speaker, and a summary (not exceeding 100 words) of the proposed presentation. If there are any queries, do not hesitate to contact Sam Moorhead ([smoorhead@thebritishmuseum.ac.uk](mailto:smoorhead@thebritishmuseum.ac.uk)).
