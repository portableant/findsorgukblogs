Welcome to the blog for the FLO for Greater Manchester, Merseyside and Cheshire!

I seem to have done this the wrong way round as I posted articles before saying hello, ah well!

I am hoping to use this blog to show people what I am up to and why it often takes me 3months to return your finds! Any research I do on specific finds I will put up on here so people have a chance to learn more. I’ll also try to put up pictures and details of any special events/rallies I attend/run.

This blog is also a means for finders (or just people interested in archaeology) in my area to get involved. I’m not 100% sure how this works yet but I will find out if people want to join in.

Watch this space for news and information
