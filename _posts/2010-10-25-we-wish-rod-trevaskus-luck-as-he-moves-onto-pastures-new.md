We wish Rod Trevaskus luck as he moves onto pastures new
========================================================

Jeff Spencer, HER officer for Clwyd Powys Archaeological Trust (CPAT) has written a short piece about his volunteer Rod, who after almost four years as a volunteer has decided to move on to pastures new. Rod has worked with Jeff recording artefacts for the PAS from Wrexham Heritage Society and independent metal detector users in Powys and Shropshire.

Jeff Writes:

[![Rod Trevaskus](http://finds.org.uk/blogs/themarches/files/2010/10/Rod-Trevaskus-at-Wrexham-Heritage-Society-300x289.jpg)](http://finds.org.uk/blogs/themarches/files/2010/10/Rod-Trevaskus-at-Wrexham-Heritage-Society.jpg)

Rod started volunteering with the PAS in 2007 and as a direct result of his work the annual totals of recorded artefacts by CPAT have virtually doubled with each successive year;

80 in 2007/8,

150 in 2008/9,

260 in 2009/10

and up to August in the 2010/11 financial year his total was already

266!

In addition his enthusiasm for meeting people and talking to them about finds and the PAS have been vital in helping build a strong and positive working relationship with the Wrexham Heritage Society, its members and also local independent metal detectorists, to say nothing of his excellent photographic skills.

Before working with us he had successful careers in the RAF and in banking in the Far East, from which he had to retire due to ill health.

The following are good examples of some of his records on the PAS database:

Both Jeff and I wish Rod a very happy second (or is it third) retirement and thank him most sincerely for all his hard work for the PAS. His commitment has made a huge difference to the PAS locally and he will be missed.
