PAS in the Marches – New Blog for what’s going on in Shropshire and Herefordshire
=================================================================================

Hi,  I’m Peter Reavill, Finds Liaison Officer with the PAS covering Shropshire and Herefordshire

Like many FLOs I will be trying to keep people up to date with some news stories from my part of the world, whether it is interesting new finds recently reported or events that I take part in. I’ll also try and post finds days and other things that I think people might be interested in. Anyway I’m new to all this technology so please excuse any mistakes as things get started. I’ll try and keep this relatively well updated but as I get more and more swamped with finds my good intentions may slip.

Will be writing again soon

Peter
