This blog was started to allow members of staff to add links to sites that they liked, comment on news and for our friendly finders to talk about their experiences with the Scheme and the Treasure process.  
The content will increase over time. If you fancy joining in, then contact me at the BM.  
For more general discussion, please visit our [forum](http://www.findsdatabase.org.uk/forum)  
Thatâ€™s all for now folks.
