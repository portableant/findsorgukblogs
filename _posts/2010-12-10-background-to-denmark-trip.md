title: Background to Denmark trip
---

The British Museum (London) has an ‘exchange programme’ with the Nationalmusset Danmark (Copenhagen), whereby researchers at either institution travel across the North Sea (in a more friendly manner than in the past) to spend time with colleagues at the other museum ‘in order to learn how their areas of museum business are conducted in another international museum, learning and sharing knowledge’. Next week (13-17 December) Michael Lewis (Deputy Head, PAS) will be going to Copenhagen to meet with museum staff, undertake research on archaeological finds found by the Danish public, and meet with Danish metal-detector users. Follow his blog to find out how the trip goes…
