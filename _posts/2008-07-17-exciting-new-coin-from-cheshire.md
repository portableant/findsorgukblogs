As promised here are more details about the Quadrans which was recorded with me from Cheshire. I have been really lucky as this is my 2nd one of these in less than 18 months (there are less than 10 on the PAS database I think).

This one is a Quadrans of Antoninus Pius (138-161), minted in Rome, 140-144 AD. It seems to be an unpublished variety of quadrans which makes it an even more important find. As well as being a rare denomination of coin, it could be unique! And this is a coin which was in a bag with c.100 other Roman ‘grots’

The coin is recorded as [LVPL-F139A5](http://finds.org.uk/database/artefacts/record/id/225828)

Obverse- Laureate head right

Reverse- Two clasped hands, holding cauceus and two corn ears
