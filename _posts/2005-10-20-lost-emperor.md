Coin of Domitianus

One of the Scheme’s objects has just been featured in the American Institute of Archaeology’s magazine, aptly titled 
“Archaeology”. This documents the discovery of the Domitianus coin, which you may hear more of come November 9th! I’ll 
let you wait for that! 
 
[Finding a Lost Emperor in a Clay Pot](http://www.archaeology.org/online/features/coin/index.html "Archaeology's article on Domitianus")  
The article does mention the Treasure Act, but probably points to the wrong place for it, the CBA pages. Instead they 
would have been better off sending them to our treasure pages which explain it for the layman.  
I think Ian Leins will be amused that the numismatist or conservator has been called an archaeologist, as he is adamant 
that he is not and will never be an archaeologist. The BM’s department of Coins & Medals webpages have their take on 
this [coin here.](http://www.thebritishmuseum.ac.uk/cm/Domitianus.html "Domitianus story from the BM")
