Treasure Trounces 2006 Record
-----------------------------

In 2006 there were a record number of 647 Treasure cases recorded in England but as of 6th November 2007 this number has been exceeded.  A record breaking number of 650 Treasure cases have been reported in 2007 so far, with just under two months still to go the number of Treasure cases reported since 1st January 2007 has exceeded any previous year and is set to carry on rising.

This unprecedented volume of Treasure being reported under Treasure Act 1996 is in no small way attributable to the great work of the Portable Antiquities Scheme and its network of Finds Liaison Officers, without which the reporting and processing of Treasure cases would be greatly hindered and this continuing increase in reported Treasure would not be seen.

More numbers, bigger numbers, record broken… and “all due to the PAS”.

1) I think it is wrong to portray this as solely the success of “the Scheme”, the real success is that more and more finders of archaeologically significant remains are being responsible and reporting them. It is these people we have to thank, not just the Scheme that collates the results of hundreds of individual actions and personal decisions.

2) In what way can the PAS claim as its success that responsible law abiding citizens are abiding by the law? The law lays down perfectly clearly what a person does when they find “Treasure” (like when they find a dead body in the woods). They have to report it to the Coroner. That’s what the law says. Maybe we need to have a Coroner’s service Liason Scheme to remind people what else should be reported to coroners, a Highway Code Liason Scheme and so on?

3) In order to see how much of a success this was in managing the erosion of the historic record by artefact hunters digging out otherwise unthreatened archaeological assemblages (such as hoards below plough level), you’d have to also present information on how many Treasure finds are being dug up and not reported. For all anyone knows, the number of treasure items illegally appropriated by increasing number of finders finders could be growing more rapidly than the increasase in the number reported. Until we know this, jubliation about having success bringing the problem under control seems a little premature. We need to look at ALL of the effects of current ‘policies’ on artefact hunting, collecting and trade on the archaeological record before we can claim they are working.

4) In order to see this “number” in terms of the mechanisms operating, we really need to know what percentage are accidental finds, and how many have been found by artefact-hunting metal detectorists. Can we see such figures for the period of PAS operation? Digging out otherwise unthreatened archaeological assemblages from below plough level involves great public expense in rewarding finders and the landowners that let people on their land to hunt for treasure. Rewarding them with (often) public money for treasure hunting. (How much have we paid out to metal detectorists and the landowners supporting them for these finds for the last year on which figures are availble?). Did all of these finds HAVE to be dug out now? And why these and not the ones artefact hunters have not found yet? There aree many wquestions here that a mere “number” completely ignores. Should not the PAS be the focus of precisely THAT sort of debate?

5) Maybe instead of jubilating about how many “goodies” we’ve got, proper archaeological outreach would be dissuading people from doing this. How many of those finders stopped digging the stuff out as soon as it was obvious what they’d got, and called in the archaeologists to recover it under controlled conditions? And how much has that statistic gone up “due to ten years work of the PAS”? That would seem a better reference point for the success of the PAS in its archaeological outreach and instilling “best practice”, not merely getting people to obey the law.

Allegedly (according to the PAS among others) the number of “black sheep” among British artefact hunters who do not obey the law always was minimal and this (allegedly) was the “only problem” with “metal detecting”. So why the trumpeting of success now that you’ve found six hundred or so that do?

The post by Caroline Barton merely states that the PAS has been a part in helping to increase reporting. It does not state that this is the sole reason people are reporting more finds.

Personally I think this article, on PAS’s website, is very interesting and is right to compliment the FLO’s. I would add my compliments to the Treasure staff who also record and adminster the whole process.

Regardless of any views on metal detecting I’m of the view that the more people that report Treasure the better.

Thanks Caroline for sharing this news. Shame that responsible detecting takes another post damning their efforts and the increase in the number of reported cases.

Good comment Paul – I wholeheartedly agree. More and more finders ARE being responsible and reporting finds. I’m glad that you see that the efforts of the PAS and various archaeologists are bringing sucess. Lets keep on with the outreach.

Corinne, reporting treasure is not “responsible detecting” it is complying with the law.

Katharine,
“Iâ€™m of the view that the more people that report Treasure the better”
Indeed, as not doing so is criminal.

Persuasion and liason with a view to persuading people to be responsible detectorists is one thing. Criminality is an entirely different matter.

It seems to me two very different issues are being responded to in similar fashions here and they shouldn’t be. PAS, detectorists and hobby supporters are universally zealous in labelling nighthawks as criminals. Why are not detectorists who fail to report treasure items spoken of in precisely the same fashion?

I will. They are common criminals and deserve punishing.

In so saying I’m not saying anything inappropriate am I? If not, perhaps you and PAS ought to be saying it too, long and loud, not implying people who think like me are rocking the boat.

Well done indeed to the PAS and its team! More and more treasure’s being saved for the nation by people obviously doing the right thing.

Metal Detectorist have and still continue to discover and act responsibly in the way they interact with the Treasure Act, The PAS and archaeology. As far as I can see we have a year on year increase in virtually every area of statistics within the PAS remit, long may this continue!

At the end of the day, facts speak louder than words and the facts are that detectorist are being reached and they are recording with the PAS in ever great numbers. To many spurious figures have been banded around by two detractors in particular….neither with any first hand knowledge, just plenty of disinformation!

The PAS has, and is, making a difference, long may that continue.

Congratulations are in order to the FLO’s and to all those who have recorded their finds and continue to do so. May the gospel of “responsible recording” continue as well as the “reporting” of treasure. Corrine… I agree with your wholeheartedly with your statement.
