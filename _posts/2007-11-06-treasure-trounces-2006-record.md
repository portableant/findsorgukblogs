Treasure Trounces 2006 Record
-----------------------------

In 2006 there were a record number of 647 Treasure cases recorded in England but as of 6th November 2007 this number has been exceeded.Â  A record breaking number of 650 Treasure cases have been reported in 2007 so far, with just under two months still to go the number of Treasure cases reported since 1st January 2007 has exceeded any previous year and is set to carry on rising.

This unprecedented volume of Treasure being reported under Treasure Act 1996 is in no small way attributable to the great work of the Portable Antiquities Scheme and its network of Finds Liaison Officers, without which the reporting and processing of Treasure cases would be greatly hindered and this continuing increase in reported Treasure would not be seen.
