And just in case you are really interested, here’s an edited version of my Research Design for the project. As you can see I’ve only got a little bit of work to do!!

**1 Summary** The 46812 Roman coins recorded on the Portable Antiquities Scheme Database (PASD) represent an enormous, untapped digital resource. They have the potential to transform our knowledge of coin use and loss throughout the Romano-British landscape and answer wider social and economic questions. This project will unlock their potential, complementing and building upon existing research, most notably that undertaken by Richard Reece (Reece, 1995).

2 Project Aims

This project has three aims: to identify individual coin assemblages and produce graphical and statistical syntheses of these; to interpret the data to explore a range of research questions; and to publish the results as widely as possible.

2.1 To identify individual coin assemblages on the PASD and to produce graphical and statistical syntheses of these assemblages

The first step will assess the quality of coin data on the PASD, and where possible improve existing records. I will identify likely geographical and selection biases in the dataset and put in place processes to correct for these. Once biases have been accounted for, I will then select a number of assemblages from individual sites within target regions. Within these regions, I will employ GIS software to map the geographical distribution of sites, whilst using Reece tables and cumulative frequency analysis to produce chronological site profiles (Reece, ibid). I will also employ a range of other statistical methods including cluster analysis and correspondence analysis (Lockyear, 2000) to explore whether any new, more efficient or more reliable approaches to presenting and comparing the data can be introduced. Coin data will not be studied in isolation from other categories of finds as has traditionally occurred. Where possible, Roman finds records from the PASD will be integrated with the site coin profiles I produce. In this regard, collaboration with Tom Brindle, who is conducting a national study of Roman finds on the PASD will be particularly important. In addition, liaison with researchers who are working on profiling sites through particular artefact types will be invaluable. (Plouviez, forthcoming) The result will be a body of synthesized data from sites across England and Wales which will be comparable to, yet more comprehensive than, Richard Reece’s _Roman Coins from 140 Sites_ (Reece, 1991)

**2.2 To interpret the data in order to explore a range of research questions**

Using this body of synthesized data, I will be able to undertake comparisons of coins finds from PASD with published data. I will also address a range of research issues, dependant on data quality. These include, but are not are limited to:

**2.3**

**To present and publish the information in an accessible format and disseminate the information as widely as possible**

The results of this programme of research will have wide appeal to academics, professional archaeologists and members of the public. In addition to publishing findings in the traditional manner, full use of the PAS website will be made. Progress reports with profiles of sites will be posted on the relevant pages as they are compiled. Articles highlighting particular aspects of the research will also be contributed to The Searcher and Treasure Hunting to raise the profile of recording Roman coins and the usefulness of the PASD.
