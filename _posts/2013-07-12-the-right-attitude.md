In July 2010, James Balme discovered a small hoard of eight Roman denarii in Warburton, Cheshire. The hoard was declared Treasure and acquired by [Manchester Museum](http://www.museum.manchester.ac.uk/collection/archaeology/). In the meantime, James had discovered a further denarius on the same location, [LVPL-131DE4](https://finds.org.uk/database/artefacts/record/id/415761) . Since the new coin had clearly been a member of the original hoard, it was declared to be an addenda to the first case, and was found to be  Treasure as well.

In order to ensure that the new discovery would follow the first eight coins to Manchester Museum, James and the owner of the land waived their right to a reward.   We’re very grateful for their gesture, and its good to see what really motivates James – here’s what he had to say on Twitter:

PS – Thanks James for ignoring the typo on your certificate!
