Forthcoming Closure of the Somerset County Museum
-------------------------------------------------

The Somerset County Museum will close to the public on Saturday 19th April at 5pm for a Heritage Lottery Funded restoration and refurbishment.

Naomi Payne, Finds Liaison Officer for Somerset, will still be able to take in and return finds for identification and recording at the Museum on weekdays until August 2008. It is advisable to phone ahead to make sure she will be in the office when you wish to visit. Naomiâ€™s direct dial telephone number is 01823 320206 and the Museum office telephone number is 01823 320200.

Naomi will be moving to the Record Office in Obridge Road, Taunton, in August 2008 and will be based there until new purpose built offices at Silk Mills are opened.

The Museum is due to reopen as the Museum of Somerset in August 2010.
