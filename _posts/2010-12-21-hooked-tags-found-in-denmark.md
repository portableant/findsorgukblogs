    <div class="entry">
        <p>John Naylor (Finds Adviser) and myself are currently interested in hooked-tags, of which more than 400 have
            been recorded by the <acronym title="Portable Antiquities Scheme">PAS</acronym> since 1997: they also
            feature quite a bit in a book recently published by Brian Read <em>- Hooked-Clasps and Eyes</em> (Portcullis
            Publishing, 2008). They are mostly made of copper-alloy, though silver ones were also made.</p>

        <p>Although these finds are quite common in England, relatively few have been found (to date) in Denmark (see
            map below), and we would very much like to know about anymore of them not yet submitted to the
            Nationalmuseet. If you have found one of these objects (that normally have a triangular or circular plate)
            please email me: <a href="mailto:mlewis@thebritishmuseum.ac.uk" class="limailto">mlewis@thebritishmuseum.ac.uk</a>.

        <p>NB: these finds shouldnâ€™t be confused with post-medieval dress-hooks/hooked clasp, which are normally more
            ornate.</p></div>
