More donated treasure finds
---------------------------

Here are two more recent finds reported under the Treasure Act which were able to be acquired by museums after the finders and landowners kindly waived their right to a reward.[![2012T640_Roman_Brooch]({{ site.baseurl }}/files/2013/05/2012T640_Roman_Brooch-150x150.jpg)]({{ site.baseurl }}/files/2013/05/2012T640_Roman_Brooch.jpg)

**Roman silver brooch**  
This beautiful brooch frame (2012 T640; [GLO-734991](https://finds.org.uk/database/artefacts/record/id/520889)) was found in September 2012 in Chedworth, Gloucestershire.  You can still make out the fine dot decoration on the top of the body.  We are very lucky that the finder, Mr Finch, and the landowner, Mr Axford, decided to forego their rewards in order that the brooch could go in to the collection of the award-winning [Corinium Museum](http://coriniummuseum.org/)  in Cirencester for all to enjoy.

 type, but it certainly would have belonged to someone with resources!  Found in Sturry, Kent, the landowner, who wishes to remain anonymous, and the finder, Mr Hogwood, graciously decided to waive their rewards, allowing [Canterbury Heritage Museum](http://www.canterbury.co.uk/thedms.aspx?dms=13&venue=3030489) to acquire the pendant at no expense.
