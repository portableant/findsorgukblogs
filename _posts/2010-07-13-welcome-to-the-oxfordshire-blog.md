Welcome to the new PAS blog for Oxfordshire and West Berks. Every month I receive lots of finds submitted for recording by independent detectorists, club members and non-detecting members of the public. Finds range from Neolithic polished axes (a personal favourite of mine!) to Roman ‘grots’ , from Saxon brooches to Post-medieval hook-clasps and everything in between. I’d like to use this blog to showcase some of my favourite finds from Oxon & W.Berks, as well as keep you up to date with other discoveries and stories from the area, including progress on the West Hanney Saxon Burial discovered during the Weekend Wanderers Summer Rally 2009. In an ideal world I’d upload my favourite finds on a weekly basis, but we all know just how busy FLO’s are, so it will probably end up being a find of the month blog!
