I have now being at UCL for a week and despite all their attempts to stop me from doing any work, I am just about managing to fit some in around enrolling, fresher’s week and finding my way around London.

On my first day as a PhD student, Sam Moorhead and I spent hours with the Surrey FLO, David Williams sorting a large assemblage of coins found by several detectorists in Hampshire. They come from a watery spring site and as I am interested in all things votive, I was very keen to analyse them. Although we only managed to do some basic sorting, it highlighted the possibilities of regional variation in 4th century reverses. There were several FEL TEMP REPARATIO types (particularly the phoenix on globe and man being dragged from hut) which were reasonably common amongst the Hampshire assemblage but which I had never seen as FLO for the North East or Cambridgeshire. Regional variation is obviously something I am going to be looking into in a great deal more detail.

Anyway, having started with a Hampshire site, it seemed sensible to have a go at making sense of all the Hampshire PAS data. And so I am now trawling through all 3502 records and playing around with them. Watch this space for some results…hopefully quite soon!
