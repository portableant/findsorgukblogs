In two weeks time I will be leaving behind my role as a Finds Liaison Officer to start a Phd at UCL studying the huge number of Roman coins recorded by the Portable Antiquities Scheme. Having spent several years recording finds and coins, it will be nice to have the time to play around with the data and I hope that I will come up with some very interesting results.

As time goes by, Iâ€™ll post my latest results and rambling ideas! Roll on the 21st of September!
