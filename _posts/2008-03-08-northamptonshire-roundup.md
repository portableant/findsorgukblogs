In my spare moments (of which I of course have many), I’m trying to put together a review of the PAS data we’ve gathered in Northamptonshire over the years.  The aim is to find out how our knowledge of the county in the various periods we cover has progressed since the inception of the PAS.  My hope is that it will result in an in-house report, with perhaps some published spinoffs.

I’m only in the early stages at present, but I’m going through the database, and noting statistics and interesting case studies and objects from each period. As I go through, I thought it might be useful to report some of these examples on this blog.  So, in the next few months, I hope to be putting up images and descriptions of some of the most important finds from the prehistoric period, Roman period, medieval period etc.  However, I won’t be covering the Viking Age (Of course I will).
