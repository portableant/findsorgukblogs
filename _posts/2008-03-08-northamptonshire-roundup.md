    <div class="entry-content">
        <p>In my spare moments (of which I of course have many), I&#8217;m trying to put together a review of the
            <acronym title="Portable Antiquities Scheme">PAS</acronym> data we&#8217;ve gathered in Northamptonshire
            over the years.  The aim is to find out how our knowledge of the county in the various periods we cover has
            progressed since the inception of the <acronym title="Portable Antiquities Scheme">PAS</acronym>.  My hope
            is that it will result in an in-house report, with perhaps some published spinoffs.</p>

        <p>I&#8217;m only in the early stages at present, but I&#8217;m going through the database, and noting
            statistics and interesting case studies and objects from each period. As I go through, I thought it might be
            useful to report some of these examples on this blog.  So, in the next few months, I hope to be putting up
            images and descriptions of some of the most important finds from the prehistoric period, Roman period,
            medieval period etc.  However, I won&#8217;t be covering the Viking Age.*</p>

        <p>*Of course I will.</p></div>
