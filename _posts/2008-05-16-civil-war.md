The 2008 repeat of the Battle was a big success, and at the event Steve spoke to many interested adults and children about the PAS (partially helped by the fact that his stall was situated next to an armourer and an enormous late medieval suit of European plate armour).  [The Battlefields Trust](http://www.battlefieldstrust.com/ "Battlefield Trust") and the [Naseby Battlefield Project](http://www.naseby.com/ "Naseby Battlefield Project") also had a presence there, so it was a good chance to spread the word about responsible detecting, and what it can tell us about the early postmedieval period, and miltary archaeology in particular. If you’re interested in this period, do have a look at the above links.
