Just in case anyone is interested, I will be doing my MLitt dissertation on Roman brooches from the North of England, 
focussing on stray finds and using PAS data. Here is my research proposal.

**Romano-British Brooches: a study of creolization in the northern frontier through material culture**

A wealth of artefactual data from the Roman period in Britain has been generated over the past decade due to continued 
excavations and recent publications, as well as the inception of the Portable Antiquities Scheme (PAS).  Despite this 
wealth of data, there is comparatively little synthesis and interpretation. This is particularly the case for the data 
produced by the PAS which has previously been thought of as not a completely valid data set, as unstratified finds. 
This is starting to change with various works by leading Roman finds specialists and forthcoming PAS Conference Proceedings, 
PhDs and other postgraduate study using PAS data. This research will attempt to pull together the data on stray finds of 
Roman brooches from the North, studying Roman finds from a theoretically informed perspective.

The primary focus of data gathering will be Roman brooches recorded with the PAS, with a study area loosely centred on 
Northern England.  Brooches from excavations offer a control sample tied to stratigraphically dated deposits, but 
excavation is naturally biased in its nature, in the antiquarian past mostly high status sites were excavated. Some 
areas are chosen methodically (e.g. the forts on Hadrians wall chosen for their dating evidence) but more recently
excavation has been developer led which does not take into account any archaeological research objectives. It is hoped 
within this project to geographically fill some gaps in our knowledge by looking at the PAS data, together with and 
compared to, the excavated data. There are c. 1300 Roman brooches recorded on the PAS database (1) from the Northern 
region, which will greatly supplement the known archaeologically recovered examples (e.g the 845 brooches catalogued by 
Snape 1993).

A catalogue of the brooches will be created which can be used alongside the syntheses produced of excavated material.  
Due to the large number of brooches to be looked at in this study it will be impossible to examine all brooches in detail. 
After data has been gathered, detailed case studies will be established, looking either at specific geographical areas or 
certain types of brooches. Preliminary research suggests the Wirral brooch as an ideal type for a case study. The type was 
first noted and published in 1999 by Philpott (pp274-285), who thought that they originated on the Wirral due to their 
large concentration around the South of the Wirral (at that time almost 50% of known examples (12) were from just 1 site). 
This brooch also seems to be a British variant on the Roman style Trumpet brooch, which makes it an interesting case study 
of the acceptance of Roman fashions with British influence. Apart from Philpotts work little study has gone into these 
brooches, it may be possible to distinguish different classes within this type once they have been catalogued more accurately. 
It is also hoped to confirm the origin of the style of the brooch, Philpott talks about the brooch drawing on a number of 
decorative and stylistic features of other broochesâ€™ and also whether the Wirral brooch influenced any other types.

Since Philpott's 1999 publication, the number of Wirral brooches known has more than doubled (from England, Wales and 
Scotland), mostly through the work of the PAS and it is anticipated that this number will continue to rise. As a result 
of Philpott’s consideration of the origin and possible manufacturing area of this brooch type, alloy composition analysis 
will be carried out on all Wirral brooches available for testing (as well as some waste products from one of the most 
productive sites). By doing this it is hoped that it can be seen if they were all made from the same alloy mix. If they 
are all the same composition it will point to one source for the brooches and will be an interesting view into metal 
working during the Roman period. Dungworth carried out analysis of Iron Age and Roman copper-alloys from northern Britain
and this work will be useful to look at for known practices (2006). Exploring the connections between the brooches 
metallurgy will add another dimension to exploring social connections. A new distribution map will be constructed and 
alongside the alloy analysis will hopefully be able to assess Philpott’s hypothesis as well as extend our knowledge of 
this regional style.

The distribution patterns of some brooch types are already known to suggest differences between the North and South, 
for example the Dragonesque brooch. It is hoped that this study may show if there are any differences in the distribution 
of brooches within the North and so demonstrate intraregional differences. The concentration of Wirral brooches with only 
a few outliers is again a good example of this. Further research will address variations within types and update current 
knowledge of the distribution and use of brooches. By combining the newly collected data with that previously known it 
is hoped a fuller understanding of the brooches in the North will be gained.

The study will be placed in the theoretical context of creolization studies, which have been argued to offer a more 
sophisticated and balanced model than the formerly preferred models of Romanization (Webster 2005). This perspective 
offers a more nuanced view of ‘Roman’ and ‘native’ interaction, recognizing the ‘natives’ as active participants in 
cultural negotiation. Such a perspective also more greatly allows for variation over time that is not found in Romanization
models. By adopting a creolization model, the study becomes more than just a review of artefact typologies and distributions 
and will attempt to look at social dynamics through material culture.
