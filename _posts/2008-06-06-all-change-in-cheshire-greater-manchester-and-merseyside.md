All change in Cheshire, Greater Manchester and Merseyside
---------------------------------------------------------

This is just to update people as to the FLO post for these 3 counties. From September I will be going part time in order to start an MLitt at Newcastle University. There will hopefully be someone else coming in part time so that the post is still going to be filled full time.

To keep things organised the area will be split geographically- at least for club and museum visits. I will continue to visit Bolton and Manchester Museums and the 5 clubs around Greater Manchester- Bolton, North West, Tameside, Wilmslow and Stockport. The other person will visit the Salt Museum, Northwich and the Grosvenor Museum. They will visit the following clubs- Mold, South Lancs and Cheshire, West Kirby and Crewe and Nantwich.

The museums will still be visited once a month and the clubs every 3 months as I have been doing so there should be no real disruption to routines, some people will just have a new person to meet. We will both still be based at Liverpool as I am now and so people can come into that office.
