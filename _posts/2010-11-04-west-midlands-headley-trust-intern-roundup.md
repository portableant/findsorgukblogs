West Midlands Headley Trust intern round up
-------------------------------------------

Since April, it’s been an interesting and enjoyable few months. I’ve assisted on four rallies (Foxham, Ludlow (x2) and the Fosse Way RABI one). There’s been a wide variety of finds to be recorded, which has been very nice. I’ve helped Angie out at some of her club meetings, so a big thank you to all of those club members for making me feel welcome.

I thought I would highlight a few of the more interesting finds I’ve dealt with over the last six months, to serve as a summary of my internship, and here they are:

An Upper Palaeolithic flint chopper from Shropshire.

I will say, that although the internship has officially finished, this is not the last you will see of me.  I am still planning on helping out my colleagues in the West Midlands team (Angie, Peter and Tom), either at club meetings, rallies or helping out with their back log of finds to be recorded.
