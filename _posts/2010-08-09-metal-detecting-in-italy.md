title: Metal detecting… in Italy!
---


I just about have time for this short post -  Everyone is keeping me busy with new finds to record now that the metal detecting season is getting into full swing!!

I thought you may be interested in reading about Essex based detectorist Terry’s recent trip to Italy.

Terry was helping to spread the word about responsible metal detecting whilst participating as a volunteer at the Gabii Project,  an ongoing archaeological excavation that began back in 2007.

To see what the project is all about, visit the project website at [http://sitemaker.umich.edu/gabiiproject/home.](http://sitemaker.umich.edu/gabiiproject/home)

Terry even wrote his own blog detailing his week on site [http://bridgetsdads-bitofgabii.blogspot.com/](http://bridgetsdads-bitofgabii.blogspot.com/)
