Roman curse tablets to go to the British Museum
===============================================

[Cursing the empire]({{ site.baseurl }}/files/2007/11/remus31_curseemp.pdf "Cursing the empire")

Metal detectorist Tom Redmayne has had his fair share of finds over the years, including the typical array of hammerds, grots, mounts and strap ends.  Last year he was out on one of his Roman sites and, not suprisingly, he found some lead.  Now, most of you will know that i don’t tend to get very excited about lead, but these particular itemswere somewhat rather special.  Click on the link above to look at the article written by our very own PAS Roman coin advisor Sam Moorhead.  Sam is doing some amazing research into Roman coins based on the grots that you are all finding, so please keep bringing them in – they are literally telling us a new story.  Sam is always happy to answer your Roman coin questions – you can email him [SMOORHEAD@thebritishmuseum.ac.uk](mailto:SMOORHEAD@thebritishmuseum.ac.uk)

Back to the curse tablets.  Tom and the Landowner have generously donated them to the British Museum, where they will go on display in the near future.  A big big thanks to Tom & T. Landowner!
