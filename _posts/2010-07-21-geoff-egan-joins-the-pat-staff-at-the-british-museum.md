Geoff Egan joins the PA&T Staff at the British Museum

[![London Bridge Anniversary Fayre](http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2529/3729007255_3839e98d2f.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/finds/3729007255/ "London Bridge Anniversary Fayre by portableantiquities, on Flickr")Dr Geoff Egan (AMA, FSA), Medieval and Later National Finds Advisor, has recently moved location from the Museum of London to the British Museum, where he has taken up the mantle of Early and Post-Medieval Treasure Co-ordinator. Geoff’s office is located in the Dept of Prehistory and Europe, so he will have easier access to the objects arriving into the museum for examination.

As most people are aware, the number of Treasure cases reported each year has risen from 201 in 1998 (the first full year under the Treasure Act 1996) to 747 in 2007; a roughly 300% increase. Over the same period, the curatorial staff at the British Museum, whose responsibility it is to provide reports on items of potential treasure to the coroner, has been reduced in numbers. The result has been an increasing demand on curatorial time, and has naturally led to longer lead times for the production of these reports.

Geoff’s presence comes at an important time, as the Early Medieval curators are heavily involved in gallery refurbishment and design and the Post-Medieval curators are responsible for a major upcoming exhibition. His role as a Treasure Co-ordinator will be to lend his expertise to the Treasure cases that are reported for those periods, hopefully allowing for them to have reports written quickly and for a decision to be made as to whether a case should be disclaimed or acquired.

Geoff will continue with his duties and research as a Finds Advisor, and his new location will enable staff in PA&T to consult with him more easily and take advantage of his wealth of knowledge for all of the other activities coming out of this office; annual report production, conference and event organisation, database management, etc. Geoff is much welcomed!
