I know it’s been a long time. I have not been hibernating or spending my AHRC grant on riotous living.

I’m still wading through the PAS Roman coin data and have now looked at more than 20 counties and created Reece profiles for them all\*. I’m also now more than just experimenting with Google Maps. At the moment, I’m using it to plot all parishes with more than 20 and fewer than 20 coins and uploading my plots into Google Earth. Just comparing these with Richard Reece’s 140 sites shows how much potential the PAS data has to fill in the gaps. When the Barrington Atlas layers come out things will get even more exciting!

By the end of April I hope I’ll have created a summary nationalÂ picture and then it’ll be time to start looking for patterns….just a small task!
