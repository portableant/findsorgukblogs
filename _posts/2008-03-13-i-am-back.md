<div class="entry-content">
    <p>I know it&#8217;s been a long time. I have not been hibernating or spending my AHRC grant on riotous
        living.</p>

    <p>I&#8217;m still wading through the <acronym title="Portable Antiquities Scheme">PAS</acronym> Roman coin data
        and have now looked at more than 20 counties and created Reece profiles for them all*. I&#8217;m also now
        more than just experimenting with Google Maps. At the moment, I&#8217;m using it to plot all parishes with
        more than 20 and fewer than 20 coins and uploading my plots into Google Earth. Just comparing these with
        Richard Reece&#8217;s 140 sites shows how much potential the <acronym
                title="Portable Antiquities Scheme">PAS</acronym>
        data has to fill in the gaps. When the Barrington Atlas layers come out things will get even more exciting!
    </p>

    <p>By the end of April I hope I&#8217;ll have created a summary nationalÂ picture and then it&#8217;ll be time
        to start looking for patterns&#8230;.just a small task!</p>
