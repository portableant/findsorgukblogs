--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Saturday, 5th April from 10am-4pm at Cogenhoe Village Hall.  
Entrance, and car parking, free to all. Donations to help towards costs will be welcome. Meet local archaeologists and historical re-enactors.

![Northamptonshire Archaeology Day demonstrations](http://www.jwaller.co.uk/nas/images/openDayDemonstrations.jpg)Northamptonshire Archaeological Society is hosting a public open day to help spread the word that Northamptonshire has a rich and diverse history, and to make people aware of the many local societies that they could become involved with. Members of local archaeological and historical groups will provide displays of their work and finds, and will be on hand to talk to the public about the archaeology and history of Northamptonshire. There will be handouts available and publications for sale. Groups involved will include: Northamptonshire Archaeological Society, [Upper Nene Archaeological Society](http://www.unas.org.uk/), [Community Landscape and Survey Project](http://www.claspweb.org.uk/) (CLASP), and [Northamptonshire Archaeology](http://www.northantsarchaeology.co.uk/). [Heritage Marketing and Publications](http://www.heritagemp.com/) will be running a bookstall offering second-hand and new archaeology and history books.

To help bring the past to life even more vividly, we also have two historical reenactors. [Sir Thomas Tresham](http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/main/w-vh/w-visits/w-findaplace/w-lyvedennewbield/w-lyvedennewbield-history/w-lyvedennewbield-history-thomas_tresham.htm), a 15th Century knight who rose to high office at court in the reign of King Henry VI, will tell of his duties and his everyday worries about mortgages and writs, as well as the necessities for everyday life, clothes, food and hunting. He will be attended by one of his Northampton tenants, Agnes, who pays the rent on time twice a year through earning a modest living making and repairing shoes and manufacturing bone and leather items.  \[Steve, the Northants FLO, won't actually  be at this event, but you will still be able to find out about the PAS, and pick up some reading materials\]
