title: Colchester’s Terracotta Army
---
Colchester’s very own Terracotta Army has been created by the towns Young Archaeologists’ Club!

Part of Colchester Castle Museum was over run in late September by a range of warriors, horses and chariots. These fantastic creations were inspired by the Terracotta Army of China’s first emperor, Qin Shihuangdi, which is currently on display in the [British Museum](http://www.thebritishmuseum.org "The British Museum").

The YAC’s spent part of the morning learning about burial customs from around the world, including the Chinese Terracotta Army, and Colchester’s very own warrior burialÂ from Lexden Mount (of display in Colchester Castle Museum).

Â The day combined the wonderful artistic skills of young people from north Essex with their love of archaeology and history to create this impressive miniature army!
