Unusual strap end donated to the Museum of Somerset
===================================================

Most finds I deal with are returned to the landowner or finder after recording. Although interesting archaeologically, most are not of sufficient interest or quality for museum display.

SOM-ABAE0: Early medieval strap end


This late 9th or 10th century AD strap end of Thomas Class E type 4 from Mudford in South Somerset is a rare type. Class E strap ends are tongue shaped and larger than most strap ends of the period. On the continent and Scandinavia they were mostly used on baldrics (diagonal straps worn over the shoulder, often to hold a sword) and that was probably also the case in England. This particular sub-type has interlace decoration in a form known as Borre. Borre style was popular in Scandinavia from the late 9th century but less common in England. Borre decorated strap ends are mostly found down the east coast, in East Anglia or Lincolnshire. This item is therefore rare in general and also rare in the area so it is particularly pleasing that the finder has generously donated it to the Museum of Somerset where it is on temporary display.

Dr. Jane Kershaw has taken an interest in the strap end as part of her study on Viking style material found in England and blogged about it here: http://vikingmetalwork.blogspot.co.uk/2012/07/viking-metalwork-from-south-west.html. She has also drawn my attention to a good parallel from Wharram Percey. Full details of the parallels and the strap end can be found on the PAS record: [SOM-9ABAE0](http://finds.org.uk/database/artefacts/record/id/496501).
