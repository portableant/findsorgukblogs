American Gold Coins on Display at the British Museum
----------------------------------------------------

October 19th, 2010 by Ian Richardson

[![](/files/2010/10/Coins-on-display-at-BM1-199x300.jpg)](/files/2010/10/Coins-on-display-at-BM1.jpg)The American gold double eagles from Hackney, for which the coroner has recently opened an inquest, are now on display at the British Museum. They can be found in the Portable Antiquities & Treasure case in the Early Medieval Gallery (Room 41) on the 1st floor. The coins are intended to remain on show until the conclusion of the inquest in early February 2011.

The Treasure Team are thankful for the cooperation of colleagues from the Museum of London and the British Museum for making this display possible.
