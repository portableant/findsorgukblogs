It has now been six months since the administration of [Treasure](https://finds.org.uk/treasure "Learn more about Treasure") was transfered from the Department for Culture, Media and Sport ([DCMS](http://www.culture.gov.uk "DCMS site")) to the [British Museum](http://www.thebritishmuseum.ac.uk "The BM site").

During that time 53 individuals have kindly waived their rights to a reward; either enabling the acquiring museum to purchase the find for less or, in the case of both finder and landowner waiving the reward, donating the find outright to the museum.

I think these individuals should be acknowledged for their generous actions. To this end the DCMS will be providing ministerial certificates acknowledging these finders and landowners in the near future.
