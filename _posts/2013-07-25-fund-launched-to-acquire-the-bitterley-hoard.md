Bitterley Hoard in the ground

This hoard was discovered in 2011 by Howard Murphy, a local metal detecting enthusiast in the Bitterley Area, South Shropshire. On discovering the hoard, Mr Murphy did exactly the right thing and left it in the ground. He contacted the PAS locally in Shropshire and the hoard was archaeologically excavated and recorded. The hoard was lifted in a single block of soil and transferred to the British Museum where conservation staff excavated the coins.

Once excavated the British Museum found that the hoard comprised 137 silver and a single gold coin that had been placed within a very fragile leather purse ([PAS Treasure Report](http://finds.org.uk/database/artefacts/record/id/430201 "Bitterley Hoard treasure Report")). The purse, in turn, had been placed within a pottery drinking cup called a tyg. The purse is a rare survival as most organic artefacts rot within the soil – this has been preserved by being protected by the tyg which had its own waterlogged (anaerobic) environment.

Tyg and leather purse

The hoard was [declared treasure in June 2012](http://finds.org.uk/news/stories/article/id/237 "Bitterley Hoard Inquest") and has since been independent valued. Shropshire Museums are keen to acquire and display the hoard at Ludlow Museum. They have already received promises of support from the V&A Purchase Fund and the Headley Trust. Shropshire Museums alongside the Friends of Ludlow Museum, are attempting to raise the last monies locally to acquire the hoard and pay for the conservation costs of the tyg and most importantly the leather purse.
