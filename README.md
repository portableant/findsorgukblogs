# The Portable Antiquities original Blogs

This repository contains a jekyll instance of old posts from the Portable Antiquities
Scheme blogs, which were lost when servers died and a backup was corrupt.

I mined these from the Wayback machine when I was in Tokyo in 2018 and have only  just
got round to finishing these.
